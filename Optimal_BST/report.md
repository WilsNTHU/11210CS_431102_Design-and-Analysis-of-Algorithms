### Optimal-BST Implementation in C++ 


This code is for the Bonus2 in NTHU coursework for Design and Analysis of Algorithms

It implements the pseudocode of *OPTIMAL-BST(p,q,n)* on the *Introduction to Algorithms* 8/e on p.405 

Besides calculating the ***expected cost***, I also print the ***structure of the OBST*** according to the format required by Exercises 14.5-1. for the pupose of
conveniently observing the structure of the binary tree.
